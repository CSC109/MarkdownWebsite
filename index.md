# MarkdownWebsite

## What is this?
This is an example website using markdown with GitHub pages.

## Markdown syntax
Comprehensive documentation for GitHub supported markdown syntax can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/github-pages/).

The below sections will show some commonly used markdown features:

- [Headings](./headings.md)
- [Font Effects](./font-effects.md)
- [Lists](./lists.md)
- [Code Blocks](./code-blocks.md)
- [Links](./links.md)
- [Images](./images.md)
- [Emojis](./emojis.md)
- [Tables](./tables.md)

## HTML syntax

Since Markdown is converted to HTML at the end of the day, HTML can be used at any point in a markdown file, and GitHub will render it properly. HTML is needed for greater customization, as Markdown is intentionally simple and limited. Click [here](./html.md) to see a few commonly desired features that can only be achieved with HTML. CSS and JavaScript can be used as well.
